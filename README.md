### Challenges
I found it difficult to get started with the generating of the grid because I didn't really know how to go about doing it. Being inexperienced with DOM, I found the notations and invocations tricky, for example *element*.setAttributes(). It took me a while to get used to and understand what exactly is happening with such commands.

### Learning Points
I'm slowly starting to understand what methods and events actually are, and what they do when carried out. Although still not fully comfortable, conceptually my understanding of certain methods is improving.
